= Lines Blog by Opoloo[http://www.opoloo.com]

== Introduction

Lines is a customizable blog framework for rails developers. It aims at making publishing simple and beautiful.

Lines is a very slim, feature-constrained, young publishing platform. It is not wordpress or blogger and it doesn't aspire to be. It needs brains, work, and time to mature. It is a framework for tech-savvies who care about their content with the freedom of full OSS access.

To get an idea of the appearance, see the screenshots below, visit the {Lines Website}[http://lines.opoloo.com], or see it in action at link: http://blog.opoloo.com

    ruby install.rb

If you need some more information or help, you can just follow this readme file.


=== Managing admin users

Currently Lines does not offer a GUI for managing users. Just open a console with 'rails c' and add/change a user manually:

  # CREATE a new user
  User.create(email: "your@email.com", password: "yoursecret")

  # UPDATE an existing user
  u = User.where(email: 'your@email.com')
  u.email = "new@mail.com"
  u.password = "newsekret"
  u.save

=== Adjust database details

To adjust your database details, go to <tt>config/database.yml</tt>

    username: DATABASE_USERNAME
    password: DATABASE_PASSWORD

There'll be 3 blocks that contain <tt>username</tt> & <tt>password</tt>. Development-, Test- & Production-Database.

If there is no <tt>config/database.yml</tt>, just copy the <tt>config/database.yml.dist</tt> like that:

    cd config
    cp database.yml.dist database.yml

or like this (in case you want to stay in your root directory):

    cp config/database.yml.dist config/database.yml

Renaming the <tt>config/database.yml.dist</tt> to <tt>config/database.yml</tt> works as well.


=== Google Sitemap

The sitemap_generator gem (https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator) handles the creation of sitemaps for search engines. To update the sitemap on server, run:

  bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping # don't ping search engines
  bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh         # ping search engines

Don't forget to adjust the full url to your sitemaps in <tt>public/robots.txt</tt>
